Hanzi Quiz allows you to practice writing Chinese characters (simplified and traditional) right within Anki! It utilizes hanzi-writer.js (https://hanziwriter.org/docs.html) within a custom card template to allow you to practice writing in the correct stroke order. As you become more familiar with the character, the quiz forces you to actively recall it more - hiding previews and animations - allowing you to engage your active recall. On the back side of each card, there is a practice mode to get familiar with new cards as well as cards that give you extra trouble.

Features:
- Auto fills pinyin based on characters but not sentences, making it an ideal fit for vocab lists.
- Auto fills meaning in English for single words.
- Drills get harder as you become better at the card.
- Back of the card comes with a practice mode!
- Includes audio support.
- Works well on both desktop and mobile!
- Supports traditional and simplified characters.

This card template is intended to be used for sets of vocab or HSK decks. I recommend modifying the deck to give you more chances to practice the card early.

If you have any suggestions, please reach out! :)

How to set up:
- Download the addon (make sure it is within your /Anki2/addons21 folder)

- When you exit the field, the pinyin and meaning should fill out automatically.
